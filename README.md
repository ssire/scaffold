Case tracker pilote (*scaffold* version)
=======

Since April 25th 2017 this project has been splitted into two projects :

* [XQuery Content Management Library](https://github.com/ssire/xquery-cm-library)
* [Case tracker pilote](https://github.com/ssire/case tracker pilote) demonstration application

The **XQuery Content Management Library** project contains all the common libraries and data used to create applications with workflow management, semi-structured content editing, formular generation and e-mail output. You can clone it to create content management applications.

The **Case tracker pilote** project contains a demonstration case tracker application built with the previous library. You can clone it to quickly get an overview of application development, or you can copy it and use it as an initial code base to create a custom case tracker application.

These projects are written in XQuery / XSLT / Javascript and the [Oppidum](https://github.com/ssire/oppidum) web application framework. They show a full stack XML application architecture in action.

This work has been supported by the CoachCom2020 coordination and support action (H2020-635518; 09/2014-08/2016). Coachcom 2020 has been selected by the European Commission to develop a framework for the business innovation coaching offered to the beneficiaries of the Horizon 2020 SME Instrument.

This code has been developped by St√©phane Sire at Oppidoc.
